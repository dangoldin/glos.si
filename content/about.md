description: What is Glossi?
---

Glossi was a startup attempt between 2011 and 2013 that aimed to take the social media content we all produced, combine it with the look and feel of Flipboard, and then create an About.me like site that people would use as their email signature.

We had a good journey and learned a lot but it was not the right product at the time. I ended up seeing the domain name available for sale so figured I'd buy it for nostalgia.
